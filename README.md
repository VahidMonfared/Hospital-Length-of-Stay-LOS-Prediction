## **Context:**
Hospital management is a vital area that gained a lot of attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. **Inefficient distribution of resources like beds, ventilators might lead to a lot of complications**. However, this can be mitigated by **predicting the length of stay (LOS) of a patient before getting admitted**. Once this is determined, the hospital can plan a suitable treatment, resources, and staff to reduce the LOS and increase the chances of recovery. The rooms and bed can also be planned in accordance with that.
**HealthPlus hospital has been incurring a lot of losses in revenue and life due to its inefficient management system.** They have been unsuccessful in allocating pieces of equipment, beds, and hospital staff fairly. **A system that could estimate the length of stay (LOS) of a patient can solve this problem to a great extent.**
